Hello World!

I just started The Odin Project recently. This is my first project in the Foundations course.

## About Me

I'm Animesh Das, an aspiring software engineer with relevant experience in Data Analysis. While I did intern in Data Analysis, my true love has been web development. I unfortunately had to step away from it due to academic commitments at the time.

I graduated from IIIT Hyderabad in 2024, after having stepped foot in the institute for the first time in 2015.

Now that I'm done with graduation and internship, I would like to pursue web-development. But I must re-learn before I completely dive in.

## About `The Odin Project'

The Odin Project is a free, open-source coding bootcamp that offers a comprehensive curriculum for aspiring web developers, taking them from beginner to full-stack developer through self-paced online courses. Launched in 2013, it emphasizes hands-on learning by encouraging students to build practical projects using essential technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. With a supportive community of nearly 718,000 members on Discord, learners can connect for assistance and collaboration. The program is designed for those seeking accessible coding education without the need for formal certificates or job placement guarantees.

Needless to say, I'm liking it so far. Although we could have a lot more projects, I'm happy making this one for now.

There's a saying in Hindi, "Seekhne ki koi umar nahi hoti" (Learning has no age). So I'm here to learn.
